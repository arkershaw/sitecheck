Usage:

	Windows:

	Linux:

		/path/to/python/site-packages/sitecheck/sitecheck.py -d http://www.domain-goes-here /path/to/output

	To specify the default page, use the -p switch:

		sitecheck.py -d http://www.domain-goes-here -p home.html /path/to/output

While running:

	s -> Suspend
	q -> Abort
	return -> Print number of urls in queue

	To resume a suspended job, call with the path to an existing output directory.

Modules:

	persister -> Saves downloaded html headers and responses to disk for further analysis. Disabled by default.

	regexmatch -> Checks for regular expression match in headers and content. To search for headers which don't match a regular expression, prefix the name with ^ and to search for content which doesn't match, prefix with _

	validator -> Outputs validation errors.

	accessibility -> Outputs selected accessibility warnings (those that can be automatically tested).

	metadata -> Checks for missing/empty/duplicate meta title, description and keywords.

	statuslog -> Logs any 4xx and 5xx responses.

	security -> Attempts basic SQL injection and XSS attacks on get and post parameters.

	comments -> Logs the content of any HTML comments found.

	spelling -> Spellcheck using enchant. Custom dictionary words are in dict.txt.

	spider -> If this module is disabled, only a single page will be analysed. Scans all files under the domain/path as well as testing targets of external links.

	readability -> Calculates the Flesch Reading Ease score and logs it if it is below the specified threshold.

Configuration:

	Configuration for the spider and individual modules can be found in "sc_config.py".

	For site-specific configuration, copy sc_config.py to the output directory specified on the command line. The domain and path properties can be specified in the config file and subsequently omitted from the command line. This config file will be used instead of the default. The custom dictionary file for the spelling module can also be overridden by copying to the same location.
